If you are interested in playing the game rather than looking at code, we have just a thing for you.  
Download the contents of this folder at the same directory of your computer.  
Extract only "Scrabble Project.zip".  
The extracted content will have a readme.txt for instruction.  
Follow those and enjoy the game.
